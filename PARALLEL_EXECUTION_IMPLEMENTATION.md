# Parallel Execution Implementation for Complex Missions

## Overview

This implementation adds sophisticated parallel execution capabilities to the Cognitive Forge system, along with fixing the critical database JSON storage issue that was preventing mission results from being saved properly.

## üöÄ Key Features Implemented

### 1. Database JSON Fix
- **Problem**: The system was trying to store plain strings in JSON database columns, causing PostgreSQL errors
- **Solution**: All mission results are now properly structured as JSON objects before database storage
- **Impact**: Eliminates the final database error that was preventing mission completion

### 2. Parallel Execution Engine
- **Standard Missions**: Single-threaded execution for simple tasks
- **Complex Missions**: Parallel planning and analysis phases
- **Advanced Missions**: Multi-agent parallel execution with synthesis

### 3. Complexity Levels
- **Standard**: 2-5 minutes, single execution path
- **Complex**: 5-10 minutes, parallel planning + analysis
- **Advanced**: 10-20 minutes, multi-phase parallel execution

## üîß Technical Implementation

### Database Schema Updates

```python
# Added complexity_level field to Mission model
class Mission(Base):
    complexity_level = Column(String, default="standard")  # standard, complex, advanced
```

### Parallel Execution Architecture

```python
async def run_parallel_mission(mission_id_str: str, prompt: str, agent_type: str, complexity_level: str = "standard"):
    """
    Execute complex missions with parallel processing capabilities
    """
    # Phase 1: Parallel Planning
    if complexity_level == "complex":
        planning_task = asyncio.create_task(
            cognitive_forge_engine.run_mission_phase(prompt, mission_id_str, "planning", parallel_update_callback)
        )
        analysis_task = asyncio.create_task(
            cognitive_forge_engine.run_mission_phase(prompt, mission_id_str, "analysis", parallel_update_callback)
        )
        parallel_tasks = [planning_task, analysis_task]
    
    elif complexity_level == "advanced":
        # Advanced parallel execution with multiple specialized agents
        planning_task = asyncio.create_task(...)
        analysis_task = asyncio.create_task(...)
        research_task = asyncio.create_task(...)
        parallel_tasks = [planning_task, analysis_task, research_task]
    
    # Execute parallel tasks
    parallel_results = await asyncio.gather(*parallel_tasks, return_exceptions=True)
    
    # Phase 2: Synthesize parallel results
    # Phase 3: Final synthesis and execution
```

### Database JSON Fix

```python
# Before (BROKEN):
mission.result = "Mission completed successfully"  # Plain string

# After (FIXED):
structured_result = {
    "summary": final_result.get("result", "Mission completed successfully"),
    "status": mission_status,
    "execution_time": execution_time,
    "final_output": final_result.get("output", ""),
    "metadata": final_result.get("metadata", {}),
    "needs_healing": final_result.get("needs_healing", False),
    "error": final_result.get("error", None),
    "timestamp": datetime.utcnow().isoformat()
}

mission.result = json.dumps(structured_result)  # Proper JSON string
```

## üìä API Endpoints
