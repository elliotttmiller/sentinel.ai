# Fix-AI: The Sentient Codebase Healer

## üöÄ Overview

**Fix-AI** is a sophisticated, self-healing diagnostic and repair system designed specifically for the **Cognitive Forge** codebase. It represents the next evolution in autonomous system maintenance - a dedicated AI software engineer that maintains the health, integrity, and performance of the entire codebase.

## üéØ Core Philosophy

Fix-AI embodies the same self-healing principles as our **Phoenix Protocol** but applies them to the system's own source code. It's not just a linter or formatter; it's a sentient system that can:

- **Diagnose** complex codebase issues
- **Plan** strategic healing approaches
- **Execute** fixes with iterative self-healing
- **Validate** changes to prevent regressions
- **Learn** from successful repairs
- **Rollback** automatically when critical failures occur

## üèóÔ∏è Architectural Pillars

### 1. **Hybrid Analysis**
- **Static Analysis**: Traditional tools (flake8, ast) for syntax and style
- **AI-Powered Analysis**: LLM-driven contextual reasoning for complex issues
- **Performance Analysis**: Cyclomatic complexity, import analysis, optimization opportunities

### 2. **Iterative Self-Healing**
- **Validation Loop**: Every fix is immediately validated
- **Error Recovery**: Failed fixes trigger re-analysis and retry
- **Phoenix Protocol Integration**: Seamless error recovery and rollback capabilities

### 3. **Mission-Aware Prioritization**
- **Impact Assessment**: Evaluates how issues affect active missions
- **Critical File Recognition**: Prioritizes fixes in mission-critical components
- **Dynamic Scoring**: Multi-factor priority calculation

### 4. **Risk Management**
- **Automatic Backups**: Creates timestamped backups before any changes
- **Automated Rollback**: Can revert changes if critical errors occur
- **Regression Testing**: Full system validation after healing

### 5. **Surgical Patching**
- **Multi-line Fixes**: Handles complex code modifications
- **Diff-based Operations**: Precise insertions, deletions, and replacements
- **Context Validation**: Ensures patch accuracy before application

### 6. **Automated Rollback**
- **Critical Failure Recovery**: Automatic restoration when fixes fail
- **Scope-based Rollback**: Single file or full system rollback
- **Backup Integrity**: Validates backup integrity before operations
