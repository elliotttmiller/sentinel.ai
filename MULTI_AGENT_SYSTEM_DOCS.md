### Configuration

Configuration is managed through `multi_agent_config.toml`:

```toml
[system]
version = "6.0"
name = "Sentinel AI Enhanced Multi-Agent System"

[multi_agent]
enabled = true
max_concurrent_workflows = 10
learning_enabled = true
```

## Usage

### Basic Mission Execution

The enhanced system integrates transparently with existing mission execution:

```python
# Existing API unchanged
result = await cognitive_forge_engine.run_mission(
    user_prompt="Build a REST API for user management",
    mission_id_str="mission_001",
    agent_type="developer"
)
```

### Direct Multi-Agent API Usage

For advanced use cases, you can use the multi-agent API directly:

```python
from sentinel_multi_agent_integration import SentinelMultiAgentAPI

api = SentinelMultiAgentAPI()
result = await api.execute_mission({
    'mission_id_str': 'advanced_001',
    'prompt': 'Develop a comprehensive AI system',
    'agent_type': 'developer'
})
```
