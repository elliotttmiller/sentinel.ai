## üíæ Disk Analysis

### What it measures:
- **Usage Percentage**: How much of your disk space is used
- **Free Space**: Available storage in GB
- **Total Space**: Total disk capacity

### Why it matters for AI:
- AI models and datasets require significant storage
- Temporary files during processing need space
- Low disk space can cause system instability

### Grading Criteria:
- **A+ (< 70%)**: Plenty of disk space available
- **A (70-85%)**: Adequate space for normal operations
- **B (85-90%)**: Getting limited, consider cleanup
- **C (90-95%)**: Low space, performance may be affected
- **F (> 95%)**: Critically low, system may become unstable

### Recommendations:
- **A+/A**: Monitor usage as you add data
- **B**: Clean up unnecessary files
- **C**: Immediate cleanup - remove files, clear caches
- **F**: Emergency action - free up space immediately

## üìà System Load Analysis (Unix/Linux)

### What it measures:
- **Load Average**: System demand over 1, 5, and 15 minutes
- **Relative to CPU cores**: How busy the system is compared to available cores

### Why it matters for AI:
- Indicates overall system stress
- High load means system is struggling to handle current workload
- Affects responsiveness and AI operation efficiency

### Grading Criteria:
- **A+ (< 0.5 √ó cores)**: Very low load, plenty of capacity
- **A (0.5-0.8 √ó cores)**: Healthy load, good balance
- **B (0.8-1.0 √ó cores)**: Moderate load, performance should remain good
- **C (1.0-1.5 √ó cores)**: High load, performance may be impacted
- **F (> 1.5 √ó cores)**: Extremely high load, system may be overloaded

## üéØ Overall Performance Assessment

### How it's calculated:
The system combines all individual component grades into an overall score:
- Each grade is converted to a numerical value (A+ = 95, A = 90, etc.)
- The average of all component scores becomes the overall score
- The overall grade is determined by the final score

### What it tells you:
- **A+ (90+)**: Your system is ready for intensive AI operations
- **A (80-89)**: Your system can handle AI operations with minor optimizations
- **B (70-79)**: Address performance issues before running AI operations
- **C (60-69)**: Significant issues need attention
- **F (< 60)**: Critical issues requiring immediate action
