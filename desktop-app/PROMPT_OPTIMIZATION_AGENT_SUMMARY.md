4. **Agent Role Recommendation**: Suggests appropriate agent roles for task execution
5. **Risk Assessment**: Identifies potential issues and provides mitigation strategies
6. **Technical Specification**: Ensures all technical requirements are clearly defined

## 📊 Output Structure

The agent produces a comprehensive JSON structure containing:

```json
{
    "optimized_prompt": "Enhanced, detailed version of the user's request",
    "technical_context": {
        "programming_languages": ["list", "of", "relevant", "languages"],
        "frameworks": ["list", "of", "relevant", "frameworks"],
        "tools_required": ["list", "of", "required", "tools"],
        "complexity_level": "low/medium/high",
        "estimated_duration": "time estimate"
    },
    "success_criteria": [
        "Specific, measurable criteria 1",
        "Specific, measurable criteria 2"
    ],
    "recommended_agents": [
        "agent_role_1",
        "agent_role_2"
    ],
    "risk_factors": [
        "potential risk 1 with mitigation",
        "potential risk 2 with mitigation"
    ],
    "optimization_notes": [
        "optimization suggestion 1",
        "optimization suggestion 2"
    ]
}
```

## 🔧 Integration
