            3. Strategize & Sequence: Assemble these components into a logical sequence of tasks. Assign the correct agent for each task, considering the complexity and required tools.
            4. Output Blueprint: Your final output MUST be a clean, raw JSON object. Do not add any commentary. The JSON must contain a 'steps' array, where each step is an object with agent_role, a crystal-clear task_description, and a precise expected_output.
